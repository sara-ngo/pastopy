# A Pascal Interpreter using Python and ANTLR

ANTLR allows us to create our own grammar, in this case, grammar following the syntax of Pascal, and it automatically generates a lexer and parser. Our program also processes the interpreted Pascal to Python. We chose to interpret Pascal to learn and further our knowledge of a procedural programming language. 


## Analysis - Implementation and Features

The main Pascal features we implemented are program declaration, variable assignments, printing, arithmetic, function declarations and assignments, comparisons, and conditionals. For this project, we used ANTLR v4 and generated the lexers and parsers in Python. For our environment, we used the PyCharm IDE and installed IntelliJ’s plugin for ANTLRv4. This allows for syntax highlighting and error checking of our grammar file. Most importantly, this plugin has a live grammar interpreter which allows us to test our grammar by visualizing the rule’s parse tree.
